/*
Write code that will continuously ask the user for a letter and validate it.

Create a new script called milestone_3.py. This file will contain the code for this milestone.

Step 1. Create a while loop and set the condition to True. Setting the condition to True ensures that the code run continuously.

In the body of the loop, write the code required for the following steps.

Step 2: Ask the user to guess a letter and assign this to a variable called guess.

Step 3. Check that the guess is a single, alphabetical character.

Step 4. If the guess passes the checks, break out of the loop.

Step 5: If the guess does not pass the checks, then print a message saying "Invalid letter. Please, enter a single alphabetical character."
